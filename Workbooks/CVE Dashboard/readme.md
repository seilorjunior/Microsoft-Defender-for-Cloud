# Microsoft Defender for Servers - CVE Dashboard

**Author: Tom Janetscheck**

This interactive workbook provides an overview of machines in your environment that are affected by open vulnerabilities with a focus on CVE IDs. It will show vulnerability findings for either Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management, or the integrated Qualys VA scanner.

Tab 1 provides an overview about the total amount and details of CVE IDs found in your environment. When selecting one ID from the table, you will be presented with a list of affected machines and software by CVE ID.

Tab 2 has a slightly different focus and will present you with a list of machines that have active vulnerabilities. When selecting a machine from the list, you will see all vulnerabilities that have been detected. Then, when selecting a particular vulnerability, you will see all CVEs that are associated with this vulnerability, including more detailed information.
